# Free Decay 

**Author:**	Fabian Wendt

**Version:**	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:**	Sphere

**Note:**	This case was developed for IEA OES Task 10 international comparison of numerical simulations to experimental data.

Example using WEC-Sim to simulate [free decay](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#decay-tests) of a sphere in heave, using [Multiple Condition Runs](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#multiple-condition-runs-mcr).  Execute the `runFreeDecay.m` script to run this case.
