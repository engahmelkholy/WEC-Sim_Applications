**Author:**  	Kelley Ruehl

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.1

**Geometry:**	OSWEC


Example using [Non-Hydro Body](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#non-hydrodynamic-bodies) to run WEC-Sim for the [OSWEC](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#oscillating-surge-wec-oswec). This example models the base as a nonhydro body, and the flap as a hydrodynamic body.
