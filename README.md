# WEC-Sim_Applications

This repository contains applications of the WEC-Sim code, including tutorials by the WEC-Sim team as well as user-shared examples. 

To contribute an example follow these guidelines:
* Create a folder on the top level with a single example. 
* Do not include results as these take up space and can easily be generated by running the example.
* Using the *README_template.md* file create a *README.md* file for your example. Include the example name, the author, WEC-Sim version, and description.
* Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). The WEC-Sim team will review your example and add it to the repo.
