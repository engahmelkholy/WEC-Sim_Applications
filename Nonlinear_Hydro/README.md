# Nonlinear Hydro

**Author:**  	Yi-Hsiang Yu and Kelley Ruehl

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:**	Ellipsoid

Example using [Nonlinear Hydro](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-excitation) to run WEC-Sim for a [heaving ellipsoid](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#nonlinear-buoyancy-and-froude-krylov-wave-excitation-tutorial-heaving-ellipsoid). Includes examples of running non-linear hydrodynamics with different [fixed and variable time-step solvers](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#time-step-features) (ode4/ode45), and different regular wave formulations (with/without CIC). Execute the `runNL.m` script to run this case.
